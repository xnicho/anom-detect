## AI-Powered Anomaly Detection in Cloud Environments

This project aims to develop an AI-based system to detect anomalies in cloud infrastructure using AWS CloudTrail logs. By leveraging machine learning models, this system analyzes CloudTrail logs to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security threats. The project is implemented using Python, Terraform and AWS services, including SageMaker for model training and Lambda for real-time detection. The goal is to demonstrate reduced false positives in anomaly detection and improved response times, providing a robust solution for securing cloud environments. The project includes Terraform scripts for infrastructure setup, Python scripts for data processing and model deployment, and comprehensive documentation for easy setup and usage.
